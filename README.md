The main objective of this study was to analyze and visualize the various factors which have contributed to the Evolution of the Olympic Games over the years. This type of analysis is very helpful as this type of analysis can be performed by any Country or Player which can help them in analyzing their performance so that they can improve their performance by changing their strategies. I've used a technique named Exploratory Data Analysis which enables you to encapsulate the primary factors of a dataset into a visual format. As the result of the Analysis, we can conclude that It is true that Olympic Games have evolved considerably over the time since the 1896 Olympic Games till the 2016 Rio Olympics.
